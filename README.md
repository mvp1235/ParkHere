# ParkHere

There are always circumstances when we suddenly need a parking spot but none are available or are available at very high prices. On the other hand, many people have open parking spaces which are left unused. The purpose of ParkHere Android App is to provide users ways to share those resources with each other conveniently and hassle-free. Users can put up their own parking spaces up for renting, reserve parking spaces from other users, and communicate with each other through messaging. All the negotiations are discussed and processed by the hosts and seekers themselves.
